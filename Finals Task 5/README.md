#### ***1. Launch XAMPP and start MySQL.***
#### ***2. Open MySQL Workbench and create or start a database connection.***
#### ***3. Implement the required view using SQL syntax.***
#### ***4. Explore the use of Stored Procedures, Views, and Functions as part of this exercise.***

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_products_2002_onwards AS
SELECT v.v_code, v.v_name, p.p_descript, p.p_indate
FROM vendors v
JOIN products p ON v.v_code = p.v_code
WHERE YEAR(p.p_indate) >= 2002;
```
