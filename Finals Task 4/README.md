# ðŸ§© *Finals Lab Task 4*
## *Task Description:*
- This task involved working with a single database containing two tables: `EmployeeSalaries` and `EmployeeData`. I performed a series of SELECT statements to **extract and manipulate** employee information.

---

## Step 1: Query Statements
**Objective:** Perform queries on the `EmployeeSalaries` table.
- ### Problem 1: Consider a table named EmployeeSalaries that stores information about the salaries of employees.
- ### The table has the following fields:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE payroll;
USE payroll;

CREATE TABLE EmployeeSalaries (
    employee_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    hire_date DATE
);
```

---

### Retrieve the employee_name and salary and arrange from the highest salary to lowest.
```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary FROM EmployeeSalaries ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

### Retrieve the department names along with the average salary for each department.
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM EmployeeSalaries GROUP BY department;
```

## Step 2: Key Schema Statements
**Objective:** Perform queries on the `EmployeeData` table.
- ### Problem 2: Create a database named employeeDB and copy and paste the initial query.
- ### The `EmployeeData` table stores information about employees with the following schema:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE employeeDB;
USE employeeDB;

CREATE TABLE EmployeeData (
    employee_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    hire_date DATE,
    manager_id INT
);
```

### Retrieve the employees along with their full names and salaries with highest paying employee to the lowest.
```sql
SELECT full_name, salary FROM EmployeeData ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

### Retrieve the average salary from EmployeeData table, where the average salary exceeds $70,000.
```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM EmployeeData HAVING average_salary > 70000;
```

### Retrieve the full names of employees who earn a salary greater than $100,000.
```sql
SELECT full_name FROM EmployeeData WHERE salary > 100000;
```

### Retrieve the number of employees from the EmployeeData table.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(employee_id) AS number_of_employees FROM EmployeeData;
```
